**👋 Hello, I’m Pascal Nkornyui**

I am a software developer in the Milky Way. I am currently working from my
basement, some random sequences of 1s and 0s that do cool stuff.

My interests include **web development**, **UI design**, **ricing**,
**computer electronics**, **algorithms & data structures**, **linux**,
**Cloud computing**, **Dig Data**, **Network theory**, **AI & ML**,
**Cyber security & InfoSec**, **Operating systems**, **programming languages**,
Sometimes **Maths**, **Databases**, **Robotics**.. The list goes on.

I use **Rust** btw.

I use **Neovim** btw.

I use **NixOS** btw (I'm not a femboy).

I love open-source software, and other normal human activities like eating
food and reading books.
