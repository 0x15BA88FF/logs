**👋 Hello, I’m 0x15BA88FF**

I am a software developer from the Milky Way, currently working from my
basement, with a knack for building cool stuff.

My interests include web development, blazingly fast algorithms,
data structures, Linux (I use Arch, btw), open-source, and other normal human
activities like eating food.
