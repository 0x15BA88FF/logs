# Welcome

**ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm 0x15BA88FF**

I am a software developer from the Milky Way, currently working from my
basement, with a knack for building cool stuff.

My interests include web development, blazingly fast algorithms, data
structures, Linux (I use Arch, btw), open-source, and other normal human
activities like eating food.

I've worked onâ€”and am still working onâ€”some cool projects you might have heard
of, like [Password Daemon](https://github.com/0x15BA88FF/passd) and [Devault](https://github.com/0x15BA88FF/devault).
